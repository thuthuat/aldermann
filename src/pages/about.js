                    <h1>A bit about myself</h1>
                    <p>I describe myself as a learner.</p>
                    <p>
                        Honestly, I learn how to do my hobbies all by myself.
                        I've trained myself in web and app development from
                        friends and online documentations. I can play a bit of
                        guitar by practising with online videos and tabs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not that I'm bragging. Rather, I think that means I'm
                        more open to changes and suggestions, and I may be a
                        pleasant companion should we ever work together.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr />
                <div>
                    <h1>What's the point of this blog anyway?</h1>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Mostly, I do this for fun. Ranting about your life is
                        one great way to lift up your mood. Since I don't really
                        have a friend I can talk with about life I'm going to
                        write blogs instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even so, I think this blog's going to come in handy. I
                        can use this as my Computer Science journal. I can write
                        a few programming guide or share codes here. Also, this
                        blogs will help me train my writing skill in English.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all, this is how I'll record my life. An online
                        diary (even if it's public, not many people would find
                        out about the page, so I think it still counts as a
                        diary), I guess. Maybe someday, 10 or 20 years later, I
                        might lookback at this and see how I have grown up.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Because life is all about learning and growing up.</p>
